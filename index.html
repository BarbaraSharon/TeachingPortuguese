											<h2>Welcome to<br />Learn Portuguese<br />with Barbara Sharon</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My name is Barbara Sharon, and I offer dynamic, well-structured Portuguese language courses designed to help you achieve fluency with confidence.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Languages and Literature from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and am a TESOL-certified instructor. In addition to Portuguese and English, I speak Italian and Spanish, which allows me to anticipate challenges, clarify differences, and make learning smoother for my students.

I am also a counsellor and currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Educational Studies and Behaviour Management. This unique background helps me create a supportive and motivating environment where every student can thrive.

My lessons are carefully structured to combine grammar, vocabulary, conversation, and cultural insights, so you learn not just the language, but how to use it naturally in real life.</p>

											<p>I have done an intensive Portuguese course with Barbara in Rio de Janeiro, and after a month we were all talking and laughing in Portuguese. It was a super productive and fun experience. She is the best!

											<p>Barbara was my Portuguese teacher while I was in Rio. I still remember the dynamic and fun speaking activities. I highly recommend her. She is an exceptional Portuguese teacher who not only helped me to learn the language but also gave me a broader understanding of the culture.</p>

											<p>Hello all, I did a Portuguese class (intermediate level) with Barbara to prepare my application to a Master of Science at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. It's been both efficient and pleasant. I strongly recommend it here; fun and professional, best teacher I have ever had. I've passed the entry test and I'm about to finish it, thanks Barbs!</p>

											<p>Having attended to Barbara's classes and seen her interacting with her peers and students, it was clear she was highly regard for her experience, knowledge and sympathetic ear. She is also simply a great person and has a joie de vivre.</p>

											<p>My first experience learning Portuguese was with Barbara. Thanks to her energy and infectious smile, the lessons were enjoyable, making it incredibly easy to learn the language. I was genuinely happy. Her teaching methodology proved to be highly efficient, and now, I can speak Portuguese very well.</p>
